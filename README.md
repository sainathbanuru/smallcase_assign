# To run the project

1.  Clone or download the project
2.  Run "yarn" inside project directory
3.  we define all the content as variables in data.js file.
4.  And the variables defined in the data.js file can be used in this format "%_variable_%" in our code
5.  You can then run "yarn webpack-dev-server" and you can see that the variables are replaced with the content defined in data.js file on "http://localhost:8080/"
